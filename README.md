# Mars Rover CLI Challenge

This project is a Laravel console command that simulates a Mars Rover moving on a grid based on command sequences.  
It was built as part of a coding challenge to practice Laravel Artisan commands, input validation, and unit testing.

## Run the command
```bash
php artisan mars:rover {x} {y} {direction} {commands} {--width=10} {--height=10}
